# tablespan

> Create satisficing tables in R the formula way.

The objective of `tablespan` is to provide a "good enough" approach to creating tables in R.

Due to the limited approach, `tablespan` is a lot less sophisticated than the
awesome packages [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/), or [`expss`](https://gdemin.github.io/expss/#Introduction).
The main advantage of `tablespan` is its simplicity and its focus on creating tables
with a single formula (heavily inspired by [`tables`](https://dmurdoch.github.io/tables/)).

## Installation

`tablespan` is not yet available from CRAN. To install from GitHub, run the following
lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("jhorzek/tablespan")
```


## Introduction

`tablespan` assumes that you already have a perfectly summarized table
that you now want to share. All you need are some **table** headers with **spanners**
without investing much time into making it look perfect. 
This is what `tablespan` was designed for.

Let's assume we want to share the following table:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
data("mtcars")

summarized_table <- mtcars |>
  group_by(cyl, vs) |>
  summarise(N = n(),
            mean_hp = mean(hp),
            sd_hp = sd(hp),
            mean_wt = mean(wt),
            sd_wt = sd(wt))

print(summarized_table)
```

Now we want to create a table where we show the grouping variables
as row names and also create spanners for the horse power (`hp`) and the
weight (`wt`) variables. The result should look something like this:

```
|                   | Horse Power |   Weight  |
| Cylinder | Engine | Mean  |  SD | Mean | SD |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | --- | ---- | -- |
|                   |                         |
```

### Creating a Basic Table

In `tablespan`, the table headers are defined with a formula approach inspired by
the [`tables`](https://dmurdoch.github.io/tables/) package. For example,
`cyl ~ mean_hp + sd_hp` defines a table with `cyl` as the
row names and `mean_hp` and `sd_hp` as columns. The output will look as follows:

```{r}
library(tablespan)
tablespan(data = summarized_table,
         formula = cyl ~ mean_hp + sd_hp)
```

Note that the row names (`cyl`) are in a separate block to the left.

### Adding Spanners

Spanners are defined using braces and spanner names. For example, the 
following defines a spanner for `mean_hp` and `sd_hp` with the name `Horsepower`:
`cyl ~ (Horsepower = mean_hp + sd_hp)`.

```{r}
tablespan(data = summarized_table,
         formula = cyl ~ (Horsepower = mean_hp + sd_hp))
```

Spanners can also be nested (e.g., `cyl ~ (Horsepower = (Mean = mean_hp) + (SD  = sd_hp))`.

```{r}
tablespan(data = summarized_table,
         formula = cyl ~ (Horsepower = (Mean = mean_hp) + (SD  = sd_hp)))
```

### Renaming Columns

Variable names in an R `data.frame` are often very technical (e.g., `mean_hp` and `sd_hp`).
When sharing the table, we may want to replace those names. In the example above, 
we may want to replace `mean_hp` and `sd_hp` with "Mean" and "SD". In 
`tablespan` renaming variables is achieved with `new_name:old_name`.
For example, `cyl ~ (Horsepower = Mean:mean_hp + SD:sd_hp)` renames `mean_hp` to
`Mean` and `sd_hp` to `SD`:

```{r}
tablespan(data = summarized_table,
         formula = cyl ~ (Horsepower = Mean:mean_hp + SD:sd_hp))
```

### Creating the Full Table

The combination of row names, spanners, and renaming of variables allows creating
the full table as follows:

```{r}
tbl <- tablespan(data = summarized_table,
                formula = Cylinder:cyl + Engine:vs ~
                  N +
                  (`Horse Power` = Mean:mean_hp + SD:sd_hp) +
                  (`Weight` = Mean:mean_wt + SD:sd_wt),
                title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests",
                subtitle = "A table created with tablespan",
                footnote = "Data from the infamous mtcars data set.")
tbl
```

### Exporting to Excel

The table above can now be translated to an xlsx table with [openxlsx](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/):

```{r}
# to_excel creates an openxlsx workbook
wb <- to_excel(tbl = tbl)

# Save the workbook as an xlsx file:
# openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb,
#                        file = "cars.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

The result looks as follows:

## Additional Settings 

### Tables without row names

Using `1` on the left hand side of the formula creates a table without row names.
For example, `1 ~ (Horsepower = Mean:mean_hp + SD:sd_hp)` defines

```{r}
tablespan(data = summarized_table,
         formula = 1 ~ (Horsepower = Mean:mean_hp + SD:sd_hp))
```

### Styling

While `tablespan` provides limited styling options, some elements can be adjusted.
For example, we may want to print some elements in bold or format numbers differently.
In `tablespan`, styling happens when translating the table to an `openxlsx` workbook
with `to_excel`.
To this end, `tablespan` provides a `styles` argument.

#### Formatting Cells

Let's assume we want all `mean_hp` values with a value $\geq 100$ to be printed 
in bold. To this end, we first create a new style object using `openxlsx`:

```{r}
bold <- openxlsx::createStyle(textDecoration = "bold")
```

Next, we create a cell style with `tablespan`:

```{r}
hp_ge_100 <- cell_style(rows = which(summarized_table$mean_hp >= 100), 
                        colnames = "mean_hp", 
                        style = bold,
                        gridExpand = FALSE)
```
Note that we specify the indices of the rows that we want to be in bold and the
column name of the item.

Finally, we pass this style as part of a list to `to_excel`:

```{r}
# to_excel creates an openxlsx workbook
wb <- to_excel(tbl = tbl, 
               styles = tab_styles(cell_styles = list(hp_ge_100)))

# Save the workbook as an xlsx file:
# openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb,
#                        file = "cars.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

#### Formatting Data Types

`tablespan` also allows formatting specific data types. Let's assume that we want
to round all doubles to 3 instead of the default four digits.
To this end, we use the `create_data_styles` function, where we specify (1) a 
function that checks for the data type we want to style (here `is.double`) and
(2) a style for all columns that match that style:
```{r}
double_style <- create_data_styles(double = list(test = is.double, 
                                                 style = openxlsx::createStyle(numFmt = "0.000")))
wb <- to_excel(tbl = tbl, styles = tab_styles(data_styles = double_style))

# Save the workbook as an xlsx file:
# openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb,
#                        file = "cars.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```
