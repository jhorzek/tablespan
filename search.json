Translating data to tibble  wb <- as_excel(tbl = tbl)  # saveWorkbook(wb, \"iris.xlsx\")  # The main use case for tablespan is when you already have a summarized table # that you now want to share using xlsx. The following shows an example using # the dplyr package:  # First summarize the data: summarized_table <- mtcars |>   group_by(cyl, vs) |>   summarise(N = n(),             mean_hp = mean(hp),             sd_hp = sd(hp),             mean_wt = mean(wt),             sd_wt = sd(wt)) #> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'cyl'. You can override using the `.groups` #> argument.  # Now, we want to create a table, where we show the grouping variables # as row names and also create spanners for the horse power (hp) and the # weight (wt) variables: tbl <- tablespan(data = summarized_table,           formula = Cylinder:cyl + Engine:vs ~             N +             (`Horse Power` = Mean:mean_hp + SD:sd_hp) +             (`Weight` = Mean:mean_wt + SD:sd_wt),           title = \"Motor Trend Car Road Tests\",           subtitle = \"A table created with tablespan\",           footnote = \"Data from the infamous mtcars data set.\") if(require_openxlsx(throw = FALSE))   wb <- as_excel(tbl = tbl)  # Create the excel table: # openxlsx::saveWorkbook(wb, #                        file = \"cars.xlsx\", overwrite = TRUE)"},{"path":"https://jhorzek.github.io/tablespan/reference/as_flextable.Tablespan.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"as_flextable — as_flextable.Tablespan","title":"as_flextable — as_flextable.Tablespan","text":"Translates table created tablespan flextable.
